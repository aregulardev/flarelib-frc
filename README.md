# FlareLib for FRC

FlareLib is a lightweight Java library that builds upon WPILib to make robot software development more fast and convenient for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) teams. The library provides a set of subsystems, utilities, and simulation tools designed to:

* Enable off-robot testing, driver practice and robot tuning using realistic simulations.
* Provide implementations for common tasks such as vision-based alignment, kinematic computations, and autonomous routine management.

FlareLib lets teams focus on strategy and tuning rather than boilerplate functionality.

## Key Features

### Vision Processing

* **AprilTag Localization**: A vision subsystem template for reliable robot pose estimation using AprilTags, supporting both Limelight, PhotonVision hardware and simulations.
* **Automated Alignment**: Command-based `AlignToTagCommand2D` for centering and orienting the robot relative to detected fiducials.
* **Game Piece Detection**: A game piece detection subsystem template for locating and processing game pieces on the field. Supports both Limelight, PhotonVision hardware and simulations.

### Subsystem Presets
* **Bang-Bang Style Elevator**: A bang-bang controller style elevator, supporting the TalonFX, SparkMAX, and simulation.
* **Generic Rollers**: A subsystem template for any rollers that don't need precise speeds, supporting the TalonFX, SparkMAX and simulation.

### Simulation Support

* **AdvantageScope Subsystem Mocks**: Simulated AdvantageScope models for elevators (cascade-continuous) and arm/pivot assemblies.
* **Subsystem Simulations**: Simulated subsystems via `ElevatorSimTilted`, `CustomDCMotorSim` - mostly forks of WPILib simulations to include features such as current limiting.

### Autonomous Routines

* **Routine Scheduler**: A simple manager for sequencing and monitoring autonomous commands.
* **String-Based Routine Definitions**: Define trajectories via string patterns for rapid on-the-fly adjustments via dashboard inputs.

### Logging and Diagnostics

* **AdvantageKit Integration**: Builtâ€‘in hooks for recording system data via ShuffleBoard and AdvantageKit.
* **NetworkTables 4**: Telemetry streaming to external dashboards, such as ShuffleBoard, Elastic and SmartDashboard.

### Other Utilities
* Classes for geometry and vector math, shooter calculations, field region divisions, and more.

### Adding FlareLib to Your Project

1. Clone the repository to a directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aregulardev/flarelib-frc.git
   ```
2. Copy your dependencies, repositories, vendordeps to the cloned repository.

## Usage Example

```java
import com.flarerobotics.lib.ascope.linear.ContinuousAscopeDisplay;
(...)

public class RobotContainer {
    (...)
    // AdvantageScope integration
    private final ContinuousAscopeDisplay m_display;

    public RobotContainer() {
        (...)
        // A perfectly upright 2-stage continuous elevator with a max height of 1.81m.
        m_display = new ContinuousAscopeDisplay("elevator", 2, 1.81, 0, m_elevator::getHeightMeters, () -> Rotation3d.kZero)
    }
}
```
